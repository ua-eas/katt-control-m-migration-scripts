# KATT Control-M Migration Scripts
======

This repository will hold any migration scripts we use when moving tables/jobs to production. The tables/jobs that are successfully tested will get moved to the temporary staging application (as a source for the move to production by the Control-M team). These scripts will be run against the jobs that are in this temporary staging application.
